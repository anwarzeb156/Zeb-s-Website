            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A dedicated and ambitious individual, I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in
                Research in Computer and Systems Engineering at Technical University Ilmenau,
                Germany. My academic journey has been characterized by a diverse range of
                disciplines, including a Composite Bachelor's degree in Political Science, followed by
                a Master's degree in International Relations, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer
                Science.
                With a solid foundation in academia, I have also garnered practical experience in the
                professional realm. From 2015 to 2019, I served as a Customer Service
                Representative at Ufone PTML, followed by a role as a Marketplace Executive at
                Markaz Technologies, a leading retail ecommerce company.
                While my professional experience spans six years, it is important to note that my
                career trajectory has not solely been within my academic fields of study. These roles
                have served as a means to fulfill my basic life needs while I continue to pursue my
                academic and personal aspirations. To further enhance my skill set, I have
                undertaken a Full Stack Development course, equipping me with proficiency in
                HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, SQL, and React.js.
                Currently, I am actively seeking a long-term opportunity or internship where I
                can contribute my expertise, dedication, and enthusiasm while continuing to
                grow and improve my skills in a supportive and dynamic environment</p>
